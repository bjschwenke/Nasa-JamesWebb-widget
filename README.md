# SAT3310-Project
This is my course project for my SAT3310 class. 

This project is a python script that uses the PyQt6 framework to create a simple widget that pulls images from "https://www.flickr.com/photos/nasawebbtelescope/with/54378060725/" and allows for the user to click through the different pictures from the James Webb Telescope. It also has a section for new articles from "https://www.nasa.gov/2025-news-releases/", where they can be clicked on and redirected to the actual article. 

The libraries needed are BeautifulSoup, PyQt6, and Requests. 

I did use some help with AI to get some of the connections working.
